Our services generally start at $1500 a month in order to provide your campaign with the necessary resources to do the job right and confidently predict a successful campaign.  If you\'ve been burned by another company in the past, it was likely that they were just giving you the price you wanted rather than what was required to get results.  We are focused on getting results!<br \\/>\\n<br \\/>\\n2) We are in it for the long-term.  We are an extremely low turn-over business and our costs go up significantly if we loose clients within the first year, so we have a large incentive to keep you happy and keep you on-board long-term.<br \\/>\\n<br \\/>\\n3) We provide realistic expectations to our clients rather than telling them what they want to hear just to get them to sign up.   The truth isn\'t as exciting as the fairy tales that other companies are willing to tell you, but it\'s the truth.<br \\/>\\n<br \\/>\\nIf you\'re interested in hearing what we can do for your site then I would love to set up a consultation call with you.

I had 2 suites for 2 days each. Room 553 and 552 totaling over $1300. We arrived after 8:30pm and immediately went to out room. In room 552 we right away noticed the fridge was not cold. We played with it and took the kids down to the pool a little after 9. When the pool closed at 10 we went back to the room hoping the fridge was now cold. It wasnt so we called downstairs. My phone call around 10:15pm was that room 552 had a broken fridge and room 553 did not get slippers like room 552 did. They said we will send someone right up. Room 552 had maintenance show up right away. He confirmed it was broken and said he would be right back with another fridge. We waited till about 10:45 and decided we need to go to bed, maybe hes not coming back tonight. About 15 to 20 minutes after 11pm he shows up again. Everyone was sleeping (kids in the living room) and i had to stay up and wait for him to switch the fridge out at 11:30 at night.   The the next day i found out slippers never came to room 553. With that room 552 had a broken light in the closet that didnt work, the safe did not work and the couch has a huge stain on the couchin. We called again the next day and asked for slippers in room 553. They finally came sometime on saturday. I also understand renovations happen however an email letting us know the hot tub was not working would have been great. We did pick this hotel based on the indoor pool and hot tub. That was a very big let down when we arrived. I hope this is passed on to the manager of this hotel.

I\'ve stayed at the hotel several times in the past and this is just unacceptable. Not only was the room itself in poor shape, but my partner and I were made very uncomfortable by the staff bringing people in mutiple times to the pool area while we were swimming and having those same people just wander in and watch us swim or stare from the windows above in the gym. The room service was terrible, my chicken was barely even warm and the burger was dangerously undercooked. Then we woke up to someone blasting the radio so loud at 8am we could hear it in our room and down the hall when we left around 10am. We tried to call and complain but got no answer and when we left there was a staff member walking around the floor with a clipboard but didn\'t seem to be interested in taking care of the noise. We ended up realizing a few hours after we left that we forgot the fire stick we had plugged into the tv, but it wasn\'t check in time yet and there\'s a cord that would indicate where it was and it would be easy to find. Not only did your staff say it wasn\'t there, but we were able to check on an app we have for it and it had been unplugged. So in addition to all of the other problems the cleaning staff seems to have a habit of stealing things. Now I have a random $8 charge on my account seperate from the bill from the room and room service. This was suppose to be a relaxing weekend for us and it turned into a headache that doesn\'t seem to end.

Staff is beyond wonderful, room is immaculate, hotel grounds are beautiful and I can honestly say, this is the nicest place I have stayed in with a $100-300 price range. This hotel is so overwhelmingly wonderful, I had to write a review immediately- less than an hour after I checked in! 15 minutes or so after arriving at my room, the front desk called to make sure the room was acceptable and ask if there is anything I need. Now THAT hasn&#39;t happened at any other hotel I have stayed at in a long time. The staff here go out of their way to treat guests like royalty! So happy I decided to stay here! Thanks, Doubletree- I haven&#39;t even left yet but I will guarantee I&#39;ll be back!! &nbsp;Stayed May 2015, traveled on business<br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;Clean &amp; Modern Doubletree in Bristol&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\nOur family of 5 had a great stay in the Doubletree hotel in Bristol, CT. We had an early event nearby which prompted our choice to stay there. The queen suite was so comfortable and spacious, we wish all hotels we stay in had this arrangement. The kids had a great time in the pool. The staff were very friendly and service was wonderful. We highly recommend this hotel.- by Susan B (New Canaan, CT, United States) on 3/31/14.

The staff was very helpful and friendly. Cant beat the warm cookie at check in! room was spacious and the work out area was&nbsp;very nice. enjoyable breakfast- by Jill B (buffalo, United States) on 3/31/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;A must stay!&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\nFrom the time we walked in the front door, we were impressed. From the friendly greeting (with a delicious warm chocolate chip cookie, and if you have ever had one of these you know what I am talking about) to the spacious room, my experience at the hotel far exceeded my expectations. The sports bar was right on the money. There were several TVs&nbsp;with many games to choose from. The food was good and reasonably priced. The service was also very good. This place has a fitness center and a heated pool, although we did not get to experience either due to time restrictions on my part. The room was very nice and modern with 2 queen beds and HD TV . It also has a Keurig coffee maker which was great for that immediate morning cup. I highly recommend this hotel and it will be my choice the next time im staying in Bristol.- by Mike P (North Providence, Rhode Island) on 3/30/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;repeatedly blown away at the customer service.&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\nJust a brief note to tell you about my experience and the attitudes at the Bristol Doubletree Hotel. I am diamond at Hilton and Gold at Marriott, so needless to say I travel frequently. I am just finishing up my third stay here and I am repeatedly blown away at the customer service. Here are a few examples.<br />\n<br />\nEvelyis - a breathe of sunshine. She has an attitude of &quot;what else can I do,&nbsp; I love helping you.&quot;&nbsp; She gets it before I know I want it.<br />\n<br />\nRestaurant - The first time I was here they had a duck special. The second time I was here I asked if it was one of the specials. It wasn&#39;t but the made if for me anyway.&nbsp; It was delicious.<br />\n<br />\nLast time I was here&nbsp; I had left my blazer in the room. When I arrived&nbsp; yesterday my blazer was dry cleaned,&nbsp; pressed and waiting for me in my room.&nbsp; Now this is a wow!&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked who was in charge of doing this.&nbsp; It was Miguel.<br />\n<br />\nI have never been to a hotel where EVERYONE goes above and beyond.&nbsp; This attitude and work ethic obviously comes from the top.

Staff is beyond wonderful, room is immaculate, hotel grounds are beautiful and I can honestly say, this is the nicest place I have stayed in with a $100-300 price range. This hotel is so overwhelmingly wonderful, I had to write a review immediately- less than an hour after I checked in! 15 minutes or so after arriving at my room, the front desk called to make sure the room was acceptable and ask if there is anything I need. Now THAT hasn&#39;t happened at any other hotel I have stayed at in a long time. The staff here go out of their way to treat guests like royalty! So happy I decided to stay here! Thanks, Doubletree- I haven&#39;t even left yet but I will guarantee I&#39;ll be back!! &nbsp;Stayed May 2015, traveled on business<br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;Clean &amp; Modern Doubletree in Bristol&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\nOur family of 5 had a great stay in the Doubletree hotel in Bristol, CT. We had an early event nearby which prompted our choice to stay there. The queen suite was so comfortable and spacious, we wish all hotels we stay in had this arrangement. The kids had a great time in the pool. The staff were very friendly and service was wonderful. We highly recommend this hotel.- by Susan B (New Canaan, CT) on 3/31/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;ESPN&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\nNear the corporate headquarters of ESPN this hotel was conveniently located. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Cant beat the warm cookie at check in! Room was spacious and the work out area was&nbsp;very nice. enjoyable breakfast- by Jill B (Buffalo, NY) on 3/31/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;A must stay!&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\nFrom the time we walked in the front door, we were impressed. From the friendly greeting (with a delicious warm chocolate chip cookie, and if you have ever had one of these you know what I am talking about) to the spacious room, my experience at the hotel far exceeded my expectations. The sports bar was right on the money. There were several TVs&nbsp;with many games to choose from. The food was good and reasonably priced. The service was also very good. This place has a fitness center and a heated pool, although we did not get to experience either due to time restrictions on my part. The room was very nice and modern with 2 queen beds and HD TV . It also has a Keurig coffee maker which was great for that immediate morning cup. I highly recommend this hotel and it will be my choice the next time im staying in Bristol.- by Mike P (North Providence, RI) on 3/30/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;repeatedly blown away at the customer service.&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\nJust a brief note to tell you about my experience and the attitudes at the Bristol Doubletree Hotel. I am diamond at Hilton and Gold at Marriott, so needless to say I travel frequently. I am just finishing up my third stay here and I am repeatedly blown away at the customer service. Here are a few examples.<br />\n<br />\nEvelyis - a breathe of sunshine. She has an attitude of &quot;what else can I do,&nbsp; I love helping you.&quot; She gets it before I know I want it.<br />\n<br />\nRestaurant - The first time I was here they had a duck special. The second time I was here I asked if it was one of the specials. It wasn&#39;t but the made if for me anyway. It was delicious.<br />\n<br />\nLast time I was here I had left my blazer in the room. When I arrived&nbsp; yesterday my blazer was dry cleaned,&nbsp; pressed and waiting for me in my room.&nbsp; Now this is a wow! I asked who was in charge of doing this. It was Miguel.<br />\n<br />\nI have never been to a hotel where EVERYONE goes above and beyond.&nbsp; This attitude and work ethic obviously comes from the top. Kudos, you are doing an amazing job.<br />\n<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nAnonymous</p>\n','2016-02-05 11:36:11','2016-02-05 11:36:11',15,15,0),

Staff is beyond wonderful, room is immaculate, hotel grounds are beautiful and I can honestly say, this is the nicest place I have stayed in with a $100-300 price range. This hotel is so overwhelmingly wonderful, I had to write a review immediately &ndash; less than an hour after I checked in! 15 minutes or so after arriving at my room, the front desk called to make sure the room was acceptable and ask if there is anything I need. Now THAT hasn&#39;t happened at any other hotel I have stayed at in a long time. The staff here go out of their way to treat guests like royalty! So happy I decided to stay here! Thanks, Doubletree &ndash; I haven&#39;t even left yet but I will guarantee I&#39;ll be back!! Stayed May 2015, traveled on business<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Clean &amp; Modern Doubletree in Bristol&quot;<br />\n<br />\nOur family of five had a great stay in the Doubletree hotel in Bristol, CT. We had an early event nearby which prompted our choice to stay there. The queen suite was so comfortable and spacious, we wish all hotels we stay in had this arrangement. The kids had a great time in the pool. The staff were very friendly and service was wonderful. We highly recommend this hotel. &ndash; by Susan B. (New Canaan, CT) on 3/31/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n&quot;ESPN&quot;<br />\n<br />\nNear the corporate headquarters of ESPN, this hotel was conveniently located. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Can&#39;t beat the warm cookie at check-in! Room was spacious and the workout area was&nbsp;very nice. Enjoyable breakfast. &ndash; by Jill B. (Buffalo, NY) on 3/31/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n&quot;A Must Stay!&quot;<br />\n<br />\nFrom the time we walked in the front door, we were impressed. From the friendly greeting (with a delicious warm chocolate chip cookie, and if you have ever had one of these you know what I am talking about) to the spacious room, my experience at the hotel far exceeded my expectations. The sports bar was right on the money. There were several TVs&nbsp;with many games to choose from. The food was good and reasonably priced. The service was also very good. This place has a fitness center and a heated pool, although we did not get to experience either due to time restrictions on my part. The room was very nice and modern with two queen beds and HDTV. It also has a Keurig coffee maker which was great for that immediate morning cup. I highly recommend this hotel and it will be my choice the next time I&#39;m staying in Bristol. &ndash; by Mike P. (North Providence, RI) on 3/30/14. Stay date: Mar 2014<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Repeatedly Blown Away at the Customer Service.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nJust a brief note to tell you about my experience and the attitudes at the Bristol Doubletree Hotel. I am diamond at Hilton and Gold at Marriott, so needless to say I travel frequently. I am just finishing up my third stay here and I am repeatedly blown away at the customer service. Here are a few examples.<br />\n<br />\nEvelyis - a breathe of sunshine. She has an attitude of &quot;what else can I do, I love helping you.&quot; She gets it before I know I want it.<br />\n<br />\nRestaurant - The first time I was here they had a duck special. The second time I was here I asked if it was one of the specials. It wasn&#39;t but they made if for me anyway. It was delicious.<br />\n<br />\nLast time I was here I had left my blazer in the room. When I arrived yesterday my blazer was dry cleaned, pressed and waiting for me in my room. Now, this is a wow! I asked who was in charge of doing this.
