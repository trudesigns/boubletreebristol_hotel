I had 2 suites for 2 days each. Room 553 and 552 totaling over $1300. We arrived after 8:30pm and immediately went to out room. In room 552 we right away noticed the fridge was not cold. We played with it and took the kids down to the pool a little after 9. When the pool closed at 10 we went back to the room hoping the fridge was now cold. It wasnt so we called downstairs. My phone call around 10:15pm was that room 552 had a broken fridge and room 553 did not get slippers like room 552 did. They said we will send someone right up. Room 552 had maintenance show up right away. He confirmed it was broken and said he would be right back with another fridge. We waited till about 10:45 and decided we need to go to bed, maybe hes not coming back tonight. About 15 to 20 minutes after 11pm he shows up again. Everyone was sleeping (kids in the living room) and i had to stay up and wait for him to switch the fridge out at 11:30 at night.   The the next day i found out slippers never came to room 553. With that room 552 had a broken light in the closet that didnt work, the safe did not work and the couch has a huge stain on the couchin. We called again the next day and asked for slippers in room 553. They finally came sometime on saturday. I also understand renovations happen however an email letting us know the hot tub was not working would have been great. We did pick this hotel based on the indoor pool and hot tub. That was a very big let down when we arrived. I hope this is passed on to the manager of this hotel. They are welcomed to email me or call me for further discussion.' in /var/www/html/doubletreebristol.prod01.pita.website/application/classes/Controller/Custom.php:177
