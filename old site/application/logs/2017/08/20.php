I am the member of HILTON HHONORS and I was staying in your hotel at room 303 within  August 13 till 19, 2017.<br />
<br />
during my stay the safe locker in my room was locked by the guest before me. Therefore, I could not use it for keeping my US banknote.<br />
<br />
at this time, I am going to leave US and found out that my envelope in my laptop case with amount of US 1,000.00 was gone. Therefore, I have a  strong believe that some one may take my money in my room.<br />
<br />
based on my careless in putting too much trust on your hotel chain. I need to learn this mishap for me.<br />
<br />
anyway, I have an obligation to share this info with you as I do not want the same situation happened to some one else.<br />
<br />
hoping to have sharing my careless that cost me an significant lost.<br />
<br />
take care and thank you for listening my above experience.<br />
<br />
Warmest regards,<br />
Tong Tjai Hwa <br />
