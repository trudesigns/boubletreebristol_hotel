I was a guest at your hotel Saturday 11/4/17.  When I checked in that morning I accidentally left a box on the counter.  When I was in the car on the way home Sunday I realized  that I did not have the box.  I messaged the hotel on my app. The box was found, and I was asked if I would like to have the box shipped.  I said yes.  I was asked if I wanted the credit card on file used.  I said yes.  I received the box.  Crushed and wet.  The poster inside the box is wrinkled and ruined.  I hand carried the poster on the airplane from Napa to Hartford.  When i said yes to the shipping I assumed someone would look inside the box to see what was being shipped?  They make shipping tubes for posters. My credit card was charged $50.32 for overnight shipping.  I was never asked if I wanted it shipped overnight.  I will gladly send pictures of box and poster.   I would like to have my $50.32 credited back to  my account please.  I will have to order another poster.  Thank you in advance.  Teresa Richards 7 Enwright Drive.

Typically the events start Thursday evening or Friday Morning and end on Sunday afternoon.  Each person would need a 6 foot rectangular table to sit at (no tablecloths needed).  Where we are now, we usually bring in the food to cut down on cost, but I am not sure if that is allowed at your hotel.   I look forward to hearing from you.<br />
thanks<br />
