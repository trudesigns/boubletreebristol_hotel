I recently secured the Lake House in Wilcott for my wedding on October 5th, 2018. The venue suggested using your hotel for our guests for that evening. I was wondering who I should speak to or how to set up a wedding block and shuttle service that day. Also, the venue mentioned there is a full service bar at your hotel. What time does it generally close? Is this something that can stay open later after our reception for guests? I can be reached via email or my cell phone number. Thank you and talk to you soon!<br />
