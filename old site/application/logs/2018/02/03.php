I've stayed at the hotel several times in the past and this is just unacceptable. Not only was the room itself in poor shape, but my partner and I were made very uncomfortable by the staff bringing people in mutiple times to the pool area while we were swimming and having those same people just wander in and watch us swim or stare from the windows above in the gym. The room service was terrible, my chicken was barely even warm and the burger was dangerously undercooked. Then we woke up to someone blasting the radio so loud at 8am we could hear it in our room and down the hall when we left around 10am. We tried to call and complain but got no answer and when we left there was a staff member walking around the floor with a clipboard but didn't seem to be interested in taking care of the noise. We ended up realizing a few hours after we left that we forgot the fire stick we had plugged into the tv, but it wasn't check in time yet and there's a cord that would indicate where it was and it would be easy to find. Not only did your staff say it wasn't there, but we were able to check on an app we have for it and it had been unplugged. So in addition to all of the other problems the cleaning staff seems to have a habit of stealing things. Now I have a random $8 charge on my account seperate from the bill from the room and room service. This was suppose to be a relaxing weekend for us and it turned into a headache that doesn't seem to end.  I'm very disappointed as someone who very frequently goes out of my way to stay at this specific hotel.' in /var/www/html/doubletreebristol.prod01.pita.website/application/classes/Controller/Custom.php:177
