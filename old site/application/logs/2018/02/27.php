<br />
I'm getting married in August at Aria in Prospect. We are looking to get a block of hotel rooms for our guests to stay. We have a combination of out of state guests as well as those that live in state, but don't want to drive back home. <br />
<br />
Is this something that you do? If so, could you provide me with more info (rates, etc)? Also, do you have any shuttle service to and/or from the venue? What about breakfast options for the morning after. <br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing back.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
