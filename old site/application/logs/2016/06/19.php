We have in mind of picking one of the following Sunday dates:  09/25, 10/02. 10/09, 10/16, 2016 with an afternoon function maybe something like 1PM to 5PM. We anticipate 60 to 80 attendees and envision a functional no-frills buffet. There would be many elderly attending and handicap accessibility will be required.  We would be interested in media tools such as microphones and big-screen TV and Wi-Fi for internet communication. I will be visiting the Waterbury area Monday 6/20 and Tuesday 6/21 and would like to set up a visit to explore things further. My name is Fred and I can be reached at 631-334-4325, but I will be calling in also on my visit dates.
