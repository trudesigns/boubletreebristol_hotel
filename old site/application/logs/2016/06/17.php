However, the last visit was disappointing. There was a big stain on the couch of chocolate or baby poo with large chunk. When I called the front office nothing was offered to help. Second, the curtain rod fell off and onto my foot leaving a bruise. There was a makeup brush on the bathroom floor which tells me they didn't clean that well to miss that before we checked in and the door handle was falling off, which someone did come to repair. (Thank you) Room service was good and on time!!! We are thinking of staying again on June 26 and June 27 but want to be sure that we have a cleaner more pleasant experience this time. Please contact me with further questions to discuss. Thank you. We stayed on May 29th last time (Sunday). Thank you.
