We are currently looking into getting a hotel for our guests (if they would like a room) and ourselves to get ready at in the morning and sleep at for the end of the night. I was wondering if I could get a quote, possibly for both a suite and if you have 2 standard rooms shared by a door for him and I get to ready?<br />
