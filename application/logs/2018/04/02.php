I have called a few times regarding blocking off rooms for my wedding this September, but unfortunately due to my busy work schedule we have been playing telephone tag. I was hoping this would be an easier way to communicate with the sales rep for your hotel. I hope to hear back from you via email!

DATA: name='Sheila Bailey', email='sbailey@tolland.org', company='Connecticut Town Clerk Association', phone='860-871-3630', message='The Connecticut Town Clerks Association is interested in exploring the possibility of holding our April 3-5, 2019 conference at the Bristol DoubleTree .<br />
Our conferences start on Wednesday evening with a reception and/or light dinner and end Friday at 12:30pm.  Most attendees stay overnight both nights although some opt to stay only on Thursday evening.  We typically contract for 65 rooms on Wednesday and 72 rooms on Thursday.  Room reservations are made and paid for by the individual towns.  They will be bringing tax free forms.<br />
<br />
Some of the details of our conferences and our requirements are as follows:<br />
<br />
3:30pm-5:00pm      Early registration typically located in lobby.<br />
<br />
6:00pm – 9:00pm    Wednesday Evening Reception – 80-90 attendees. Cash bar.  This event is sponsored by the host county and is sometimes held offsite at a nearby iconic location.  The  location of this reception is not decided until approximately 4 months prior to the event so should not be part of any attrition figures.<br />
<br />
7:00am – 8:00am -  Thursday Registration tables (2) in foyer<br />
                                Continental Breakfast Buffet – 150<br />
8:00am – 4:30pm    General Session 150 attendees.  Vendors join us for lunch so room needs to be set up for 200<br />

<br />
7:30am – 8:30am    Friday Hot Breakfast Buffet 100<br />
8:30am – 12:30pm   Meeting 100<br />
<br />
15-20 Vendors will need an area to set up displays on 6-foot tables with 2 chairs.  10-12 of them will require electricity.  In the same general area, we will need 3-4 6-foot tables for raffle items.  The vendors set up Wednesday afternoon and will take down by 4:30pm on Thursday.  Raffle items are picked up during our banquet dinner on Thursday evening. We will schedule a break late morning and late afternoon where conference attendees visit with these vendors.  <br />
<br />
In addition to our vendors, 12-14 government agencies will attend which will also require 6 foot tables.  They arrive Thursday morning and leave Thursday by 4:00-4:30pm. They are often set up in the hallway or foyer of the ballroom in which we are holding our general session.  <br />
