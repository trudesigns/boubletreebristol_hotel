Google is really the new phone book and I'd like to help you to be listed at the top.  People in your area are searching for your services every day.  I specialize in helping them find you by having you listed at the top of Google for the keywords they're searching for.  <br />
Do you have some time in the next couple of days that we could jump on a quick call and see if there is an opportunity for us to work together?  No pressure.  I just know that I can bring you more clients, so if it's something that you're interested in, I think we should talk.  <br />
Let me know what you think.  I'll look forward to hearing from you.  <br />
Thanks!<br />
