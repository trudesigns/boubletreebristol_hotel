My name is Deana Gagliardi.  I am getting married on Saturday, June 10, 2017, and am looking for information about hotels for two things: booking a block of rooms, and having space for our guests to get together after the wedding.  <br />
<br />
Can you tell me a little about the cost and process of blocking off rooms for guests?<br />
<br />
Our wedding reception is over at 5:00 p.m.  Since we will have people visiting from out of town, we would like to have a space for guests to gather after the wedding to spend some more time together. (We are inviting 160 people to the wedding, but are working to get a sense of how many people will be coming so we can determine how much space we would need.) What we are hoping to do is book a conference/banquet room for our guests to gather after the wedding, then have pizza delivered and desserts/cookies made my family put out for our guests to enjoy.  Does your hotel allow people to rent a room and bring their own food/beverages, or does food need to be catered by your hotel?  Does your hotel have a bar that guests could purchase drinks at?  Any information you could provide would be helpful in shaping what our plans will be. I thank you in advance for your time.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
