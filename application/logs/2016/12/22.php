I'm reaching out to find out if there are changes or improvements that you'd like to make to your site.  Have you been thinking about updating your site to a more modern look and feel or adding some features to the site that automate some of your business processes?  If so, I'd really love to speak with you.  <br />
<br />
Is there a time we can speak in the next couple of days that would work for you?  I can provide you with some suggestions of different things that I've done that have made a big impact on my clients' sales.  I'd love to be able to help out.  <br />

Let me know what number to call and what time works out best for you and I'll do my best to make it work.  <br />
