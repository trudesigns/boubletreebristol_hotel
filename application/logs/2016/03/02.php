Their information is below. DATA: name='Ed Frez', email='genius2design@gmail.com', company='[Not Provided]', phone='302-316-3863', message='I'd like to speak with you about making some changes to your website that will help you get better results.  We are able to take your current site and transform it into a business generation machine that will make it your best marketing tool, improving your traffic and sales. <br />
<br />
What I'd like to do is jump on the phone with you for about 10 or 15 min and have you tell me about your business goals and see if there are some things I can do on my end to help you achieve those goals.  It doesn't take long to tell if we're the right fit for each other, but I can guarantee you that the information I provide will be beneficial either way.   <br />
<br />
One of the best things that we do as opposed to other companies is that we have financing available from 12-24 months. This allows you to do the things you need to do for your site without breaking the bank.  <br />
<br />
Just let me know what the best time is to catch you (and best number) and I'll be happy to give you a call.  If you are not interested just let me know and I won't message you again.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
