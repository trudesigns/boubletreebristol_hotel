Their information is below. DATA: name='Shelby Nixon', email='seriousdesign1@gmail.com', company='[Not Provided]', phone='(701) 484-1642', message='This is Shelby and I am a web designer.  I assist my client's by getting them great sales leads and creating beautiful sites within their budget.<br />
<br />
My forte is helping my clients get the look and feel they want out of their website as well as making sure they can be found online.<br />
<br />
When looking at a new project I offer a no charge consultation to give my client's a chance to get a better understanding of what I do and to see if my services would be a good fit for their business. This brief consultation will give us the time to discuss your goals or problems with your site and for me to help point you in the right direction (even if it's not with me).<br />
<br />
Let me know what time works for you to speak and the best phone number to call you on and I will be happy to call you.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to speaking with you.<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon.<br />
<br />
Shelby Nixon<br />

Even if we don't end up working together in the end I will at least be able to answer any of your question's that you may have. If you are not interested in my help or do not want to be contacted just let me know by replying with the word remove in the subject line.
