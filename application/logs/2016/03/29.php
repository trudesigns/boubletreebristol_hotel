My fiance' left a message with the housekeeping supervisor yesterday morning and we never heard anything back. We are talking about $50 worth of clothes that weren't placed near a trashcan, and I would like to speak with the manager in regards to this situation so it can be rectified. I also accidentally left my laptop in its case in the hotel room. It is supposed to be getting shipped back to me. I am emailing because I will be at work the rest of the week and would like to get this situation taken care of.<br />
