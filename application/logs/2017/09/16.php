I am Jean, an expert web developer/designer. I can show you some of my previous works so you can see what I'm made of. My primary goal in reaching out to you is because there is great potential in making your website great. The general elements necessary to make it awesome are already there but I want to share with you some ideas I have to make it even better. You don't have to worry about my rates because they are very affordable.<br />
<br />
We can talk about it through the phone so I can tell you what I think can be made better and you can tell me if you want these changes on your site. <br />
I would very much appreciate it if you reply.<br />

Warmest regards,<br />
