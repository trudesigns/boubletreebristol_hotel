I just wanted to gather some information and costs for hosting a social event at your location around Sept/Oct.  I don't have a firm gust list but it would be absolute max of 100 people.  Can you let me know what you offer for such an event.  I was looking for a sunday in the morning around 10/11<br />
<br />
Thank You' in /var/www/html/doubletreebristol.prod01.pita.website/application/classes/Controller/Custom.php:333
