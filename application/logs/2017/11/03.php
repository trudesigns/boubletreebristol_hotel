I'm a web designer/developer that builds websites for small businesses.  My sites look exceptional and help my clients to increase profits. I would love to have the chance to show you my skills and talents. I specialize in WordPress website platform (I can tell you more about it and how this can greatly magnify your business if you're not familiar with it), but I am also familiar and skilled with many other platforms and shopping carts as well.<br />
<br />
If you're interested, I can upgrade your existing website or build you a new one completely that has all of the modern features and functionality.  If you have some free time within the next few days, I'd be happy to give you a quick call. I can give you some of my ideas to maximize your site's effectiveness and profitability, get your feedback and then give you a proposal.<br />
<br />
Hoping to hear from you,<br />
