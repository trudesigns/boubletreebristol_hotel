My name is Saket Parekar. This is in reference to my stay at the Bristol DoubleTree hotel between Oct 24-27 (Confirmation no. 53688615). I had a wonderful stay in the hotel. This was an official trip and the bill was settled by my employers. However, a few days after checkout, I noticed that my personal credit card, which I had provided at the time of check-in, has also been charged a certain additional amount. Could you please provide the details about these charges and send the related invoices? (I believe my room no. was 404)<br />
<br />
Thank you.' in /var/www/html/doubletreebristol.prod01.pita.website/application/classes/Controller/Custom.php:177
