Your site looks like it could use some help with its rankings in the search engines. Have you ever had any optimization work done to it?  It looks like your site wasn't set up properly with the right keywords to make it easy for Google or Bing to find it. With that in mind, I assume you're not getting very many visitors to your site. I work as a freelance optimizer and can do everything that needs to be done to help you rank higher in the Google searches.  Please tell me if you're interested in speaking.<br />

Sincerely,<br />
Frank Henderson' in /var/www/html/doubletreebristol.prod01.pita.website/application/classes/Controller/Custom.php:177
