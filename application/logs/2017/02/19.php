<br />
I am a Catholic Priest in the Old Catholic Church. I am available to officiate at Catholic weddings. The weddings can take place on-site at your facility.<br />
<br />
I accommodate those who do not belong to any specific church or denomination, but wish to have a Catholic wedding ceremony nonetheless. I offer ceremonies that range from a Catholic Non-Mass Ceremony to a full Catholic Mass. All ceremonies include the Exchange of Vows. I am flexible, and am able to work with the couples to personalize each ceremony to their specific desires and needs.<br />
<br />
I also welcome those who are divorced and are unable to be married by a Roman Catholic Priest. As Old Catholics, we do not have the same restrictions on subsequent marriages and we do not requirement an annulment.<br />
<br />
If you are working with any couples that are using your facility for their wedding ceremony, and desire a Catholic wedding, please feel free to contact me, or give my information to those couples. I will be happy to work with them, and you, to accommodate their desires, and officiate at their wedding ceremony. <br />
<br />
They may also find more information at my website: fralexg.org. I can be contacted at gorecki_fr.al@yahoo.com or at 860-839-3700. <br />
<br />
Thank you and God Bless,<br />
<br />
Fr. John Gorecki <br />
