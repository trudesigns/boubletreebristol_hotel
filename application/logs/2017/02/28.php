I was looking for some information about potentially booking a graduation party for approximately 40-50 people.  The event date is Saturday May 6th at 5:30 pm.<br />
Would you be able to email me pricing and what space you would suggest?  We are looking for something casual.  Online your patio space looks perfect for what we are thinking, but the weather that time of year can be an issue.  <br />
I appreciate any information<br />
Thanks<br />
